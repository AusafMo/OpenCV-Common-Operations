### About the Haar-Cascade Classifier Code for Gender Recognition

1) Well, it turns out, in a classic fashion, I  didn't realize that haar cascade is a BINARY Classifier as someone pointed out on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27966447/gender-recognition-haarcascade), they suggested some alternatives like making two classifiers for male and female, and then comparing them to return the result. <br>
And I am not doing that, not only it's not up to the use case requirements I have, but also sounds like a lot of (unnecessary?) work for a basic haar-cascade and I've got tea to make. <br>
Instead, I'd rather train a ResNet or other pre-trained models (in another repo probably dedicated to this task). <br>
 I revised the basics though, that's a plus (ig ðŸ™ƒ). <br>

2) The dataset I used and will be using in the future is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maciejgronczynski/biggest-genderface-recognition-dataset).

3) What parameters mean in face_detect.py's haar_cascade.detecMultiscale() method : [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20801015/recommended-values-for-opencv-detectmultiscale-parameters)
